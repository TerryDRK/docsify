# Summary

Having a personal website is super exciting. You are able to use it as your personal cloud drive, media repo, or even online VS Code workspace. I have just started with this website and I have not decided what services to run on it. Once I started adding more services, I will make sure to update the notes.

Thanks for liking this long note! If you find this note helpful, please give this [repo](https://github.com/TerryDRK/docsify) a star âœ¨! You can also check out other notes I have.
